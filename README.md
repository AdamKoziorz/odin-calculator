# odin-calculator

I am completing various small projects as part of the Odin Project. "Calculator" is the fifth and last project in the Foundations course, which tests all content covered in the Foundations course (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to create a basic calculator for users to interact with.

Please note that this calculator is not fully responsive across devices (this is not covered yet in the curriculum).
